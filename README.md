# An Improved Switch Migration Decision Algorithm for SDN load balancing.
The code is written to show the most effective controller selection
Among the set of under-loaded controllers during switch migration.
The switch migration happens when the load of a controller surpasses the predefined 
load threshold set by the decision makers
Three controllers scenarios were simulated. The first one is the nearest controller 
and is represented in the code as "N", while the second controller selector is known as 
the Least Loaded controller and is represented as "L", the third controller selector is
known as the most appropriate controller based on the incoming traffic which ensures that maximum 
clustered resouurces are left free. It is represented in the code as "M".
